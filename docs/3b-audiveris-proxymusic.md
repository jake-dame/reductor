# The ProxyMusic Library (Audiveris)

The library is good, but there is no documentation (except for a small unit test).

The is understandable, because it seems to be a library meant for their (Audiveris's) main software, rather than a public-facing library (although it is public).

Thankfully, most of the code is just getters and setters.
