# Appendix A: The Term "Classical", The Term "Reduction", and Brief Historical Info

# Terminology: classical

## Most Basic Definition

"Classical music", at its simplest definition (one of many), might be described simply as the counterpart to folk music.

Because defining those further is slippery territory, and I don't particularly want my house egged, I will not attempt to do so.

## "classical" vs. "Classical"

Within European art music, there is a distinction to be made between the terms "classical" and "
Classical":

+ "classical" -- little c: the everyday/common usage; refers to the broad genre
    + Example: "I like putting on classical radio", "I study classical music"
+ "Classical" -- big C: refers to a very specific era and style
  *within* the genre, spanning roughly 1750-1820 -- and falling between the Baroque Era and Romantic Era.
    + Example: "Mozart (1756-91) was a composer of the Classical Era."

## Roots in Antiquity

The term "classical", in the music context, has the same meaning as it does when applied to philosophy, architecture, literature, art, etc. Sometimes this is referred to as "neoclassical" when it refers to revivalist movements. Major figures in scientific/artistic movements in the Renaissance and Enlightenment who drew inspiration from "classical" principles include:

+ Artists like Raphael and Michelangelo
+ Architects like Palladio and Alberti
+ Philosophers like Voltaire and Rousseau
+ Authors like Goethe, Milton, Pope

It all derives inspiration from the artistic and scientific principles of antiquity -- ancient Rome and Greece. In the music context, this mostly refers to the music theory established by the Greeks. Pythagoras discovered the ratios for what are considered "consonant" (pleasant-sounding) and intervals. The foundations of today's musical notation, theory of harmony, etc., can be traced backed to ancient Greece.

In the Classical Era proper, there was an even more intense focus on harmony in both structure and sound, symmetry, rational construction, simple beauty, stoicism, etc.

At the same time, the virtues of the Enlightenment (again stemming from ancient Roman and Greek philosophies)
and of humanism became evident in music, too. Secular music became dominant, the dissemination of musical performances and notated music to the masses, compositions meant to be played at home or to showcase soloists and musical groups cooperating all developed during this time.

## Where "classical" Falls Short

This is both hotly debated and more complex than I am prepared to present, so I am going to keep things high-level and encourage the reader to seek more information elsewhere if interested.

"classical" is a slippery term for a couple of reasons:

+ It's ambiguous
+ It is conflated with the classical music and tradition that was largely established in a single region of the world by a single culture during a pretty long time ago.

If "classical" means "stemming from the time-honored traditions of forebearers or ancestor civilizations", then there is no implication that this needs to be ancient Greece or Rome.

Indeed, "classical music" is a fixture in other, non-European world cultures, including:

+ Indian classical music, carnatic music, etc.
+ Indonesian classical music
+ Chinese classical music
+ And more

So to hijacking the term "classical music" to refer purely to the music developed by the monks in Notre Dame and Bach and Beethoven and the like seems to be overly generic.

So if we follow the pattern of the list above, the "classical music" that includes Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, might be better termed as "European classical music".

Indeed, there are factions within the musicology and study of formal music (i.e. classical music)
that suggest migrating to these terms for the aforementioned genre:

+ Western art music
+ European art music

## As It Applies to reductor

Admittedly, this project focuses purely on **European art music
**. It does not handle different scales, microtonality, instruments, notations, forms, etc., of non-European art music. Why? Because I am only trained in European art music. It is a limitation rather than a value decision!

It's a narrowly focused program, to be sure. But if there were applications in other musics, and another developer with the respective background/training wanted to work on additions, I would absolutely welcome that.

# Terminology: reduction

## Most Basic Definition

I'll cut to the chase:

+ Reduction: the transformation of piece of music so that it is playable by fewer musicians than it was intended for.


For examples of all the below, see the

## Splitting Hairs

However, that's an overly broad definition for how it is used 99.9% of the time:

+ Reduction: the transformation of a multi-instrument piece so that it as playable on a piano by a single pianist

You might also see:

+ "Orchestral reduction": I like this term, but it is slightly too-specific (i.e. what if the piece being reduced is a choral piece).
+ "Piano reduction": this is used a lot. It is the most common, but it is used casually and is technically a misnomer. It implies that the thing being reduced is a piano work. Nonetheless, you will see this term used a lot.
+ I will probably use both interchangeably in documentation and code due to the fact that I grew up referring to it as a piano reduction, and only recently realized that it should probably be orchestral reduction.

If you can't already tell, I love all things terminology. However, what exactly "reduction" means obviously also has implications for the project.

A reduction aims to be as lossless and as faithful to the source material as possible. The sole criterion for the transformation of source material is playability. This is usually a subtractive process, but might include adapting textures that are more idiomatically pianistic in order to compensate for textures applicable to strings, timpanis, etc.

+ Example: removing notes because there are more than the typical hand can play
+ Example: transforming divisi tremolos of a chord meant for strings into a rotating tremolo for a pianist's hand

## Transcriptions, et al.

The terms discussed in this section may have slightly different meaning in other applications and in their everyday meanings than they do in music (sort of like "compilation" in computer science compared to what that means in the dictionary):

+ Transcription
+ Paraphrase/Reminiscence/Fantasia/Fantasy
+ Arrangement

Additionally, all of these forms (except arrangement) are used almost exclusively in terms of pieces of music composed for a pianist / the piano.

### Transcription

In most nonmusical contexts, "transcription" means the relocation of information from one place to another, or from one form of medium to the other:

+ RNA transcription
+ Voice-to-text transcription

The implication in the everyday definition is that this is a lossless process.

In music, transcription usually implies that some artistic liberty is taken with the process, and non-source material is interpolated with the source material. Transformations, reductions, asides, bridges, etc., might be added by a transcribing composer.

### Transcription Sub-Genres

Concert transcriptions, paraphrases, reminiscences, rhapsodies, and fantasias/fantasies* are all nearly synonymous, and are all basically just forms of transcription, but with emphases on introducing even more original material to the source material.

1. *: The other original musical form "fantasy" is not being discussed here, e.g., the fantasias/fantasies of Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, etc.

The above list of musical forms are sort of an historical oddity, and were written almost entirely by one group of musicians in a very specific span of decades: the virtuoso pianists and "
pianist-composers" of the mid- to late- 19th-Century, e.g. Liszt, Thalberg, Alkan, Busoni, Tausig, etc.

The major difference

Basically, some work was adapted for the piano, but the degree to which bridges/segues, introductions, or other structural interpolations, as well as virtuosic effects intended to dazzle concert audiences, is much higher than that of a transcription. They usually focused on selections from larger works, such as operas, and in this sense more resemble medleys or collages.

Liszt wrote all of those listed, as well as transcriptions. As the Romantic Era ended, pianists and composers sort of went back to just calling them "transcriptions".

+ Wilhelm Kempff, the great 20th Century pianist, wrote many transcriptions of Bach works, among others
+ Leopold Stokowski, the great 20th Century conductor, wrote transcriptions for the orchestra of Bach works written for solo keyboard instruments

Other related terms that are more-or-less synonymous with fantasy or transcription include *
*rhapsody**

+ e.g. Rachmaninoff's [*Rhapsody on a Theme of
  Paganini*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThTU04p3drM)
  based on Paganini's [24th Caprice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ307sM0t-0)).

Additionally, some "Theme and Variations" pieces (when based on another work) are similar to transcriptions or paraphrases:

+ e.g. Chopin's [*Variations on "LÃ  ci darem la mano"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BiMnduoOcE)
  from an [aria](https://youtu.be/SJRZxSclj70?si=tq8yeU-iKm2QmWrk&t=50) in Mozart's *Don Giovanni*).

### Arrangements and Medleys

Finally, the "arrangement" or "medley" are the most familiar forms of musical adaptation to most people. Arrangements can be very generic (closer to transcription) or wildly transformed (closer to concert-transcriptions or fantasias).

Arrangement usually just involves adapting a piece written for some instrumentation for another instrumentation.

+ "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" arr. for 3 guitars
+ "Bohemian Rhapsody" arr. for a capella choir
+ etc.

There is no shortage of YouTube videos of people making piano arrangements for the Interstellar soundtrack, or Michael Jackson songs, or what have you.

### Additional Notes

#### Orchestration

Orchestration is indeed a form of adaption/arrangement, usually of something written for a solo keyboard, or for a work that the composer wrote at the piano but intended to be for orchestra.

Orchestration is not exactly equal to transcription, because orchestration involves a lot more than just adapting. There is a lot of literature on orchestration, and it is considered a formal and theory-heavy process (thanks Berlioz) that is more concerned with the timbres of individual instruments, balance, textures, etc.

Some composers wrote for the piano, some composers used a piano while writing an orchestral score, and some just wrote orchestral parts out directly.

Some pieces are more known in their orchestrated form than their original form.

+ Example: "Pictures at an Exhibition" was written as a piano work by Mussorgsky. Today, however, the orchestration by Ravel is by far the more prominent version.

#### Credits Conventions

Transcriptions et al. usually credit composer and transcriber/arranger by simply placing a hyphen between the surnames. Which order (composer first vs. transcriber first) largely depends on tradition.

+ The Bach-Busoni Chaconne is always referred to as that. It is Busoni's transcription of the chaconne from Bach's
  *Partita II for Violin*.
+ However, most things written by Liszt place his name first... e.g. the Liszt-Beethoven symphonies or the Liszt-Schubert song transcriptions.

## Performance Applications

Should transcriptions, reductions, and other derived works be taken seriously? Outside home use, that largely depends on tradition, convention, and which piece you are talking about.

For transcriptions, there is some amount of pearl-clutching in the piano competition world whether it is "proper" to include a derived work as an entry. Some pieces are okay, some pieces are frowned upon.

+ The Bach-Busoni Chaconne is a competition mainstay.

While transcriptions, etc., are more for performance, reductions are more for utility.

+ A pianist might use a reduction of the score for Swan Lake during ballet rehearsals
+ A conductor might use a reduction for the musical "Fiddler on the Roof" to conduct off of in performance.

Reductions are meant to show exactly what is going on in the full score, but condensed onto a single grand staff. Reductions may even include unplayable notes in a smaller font, with directions as to which instrument is playing. They are more for utility than for performance.

Some transcriptions almost lose their relationship with their source material, and the source material becomes primarily known by the public via the transcription!

+ All of Bach's solo harpsichord concertos are just solo keyboard arrangements of orchestral works by other popular composers of the time, e.g. Vivaldi, Marcello, et al.

# Franz Liszt and the Beethoven Symphonies

This section explains the actual inspiration and origin of the reductor project: the [Liszt-Beethoven Symphonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven_Symphonies_(Liszt)), which are, according to musicologist Dr. Alan Walker "arguably the greatest work of transcription ever completed in the history of music."

Franz Liszt (1811-1886) was a Hungarian (although he spent most of his professional life in Germany) pianist and composer, often considered the greatest pianist of all the time, and a composer who influenced and molded the modern piano repertoire and canon almost more than any other composer.

Beethoven (1770-1827) was a German composer (although he spent most of his life in Vienna), often considered either
_the_ greatest composer of all time, or one of the greatest composers of all time (alongside Bach and Mozart).

Beethoven's nine symphonies are considered one of the most monumental achievements and omnipresent bodies of work in all of classical music.

Liszt was certainly aware of this, and possessed faculties and skills that made him better-suited for the job of creating reductions of the Beethoven symphonies than almost anyone else.

+ This would be like a giant of popular music covering songs of another, e.g., Whitney Houston and Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love You".

The Liszt-Beethoven symphonies are
*actually* called transcriptions. However, they are really reductions. They are very different in style and composition than Liszt's other transcription-like works, such as the
*Rigoletto Paraphrase* or *Don Juan Fantasy*.

+ Liszt wrote many transcriptions of French, German, and Italian operas by Mozart, Wagner, Bellini, Verdi, Meyerbeer, etc.

Interestingly, the Liszt-Beethoven symphonies (the group of works that inspired this project) have always existed in relative obscurity.

Liszt wrote them - in what is considered to be the ultimate feat of piano transcription - in order to "democratize" them -- that is, to make the music of Beethoven available to the common man, or one who couldn't necessarily afford tickets to the opera house or concert hall to see these symphonies performed.

The ultimate irony here is: the Liszt-Beethoven symphonies are virtually unplayable.

Bless his heart, but Liszt was just too much of an inhumanly-abled virtuoso to know what was "playable" by typical concert pianist, let alone the common man.

They are rarely, if ever, performed, and only a handful of recordings exist. (When compared to the recording-frequency of other standards in the piano repertoire, it's not even close.)

+ Recordings of the complete cycle have been made by: Idil Biret (who was first to record them); Cyprien Katsaris, Konstantin Scherbakov, Yury Martynov, and Hinrich Alpers.


# The reductor Application

What does any of this have to with my project other than the mere fact that I love to talk about this stuff? Not a lot, but there
*are* some implications.

Reduction needs to be a process of as little information loss
*or* insertion as possible, and any sort of transformation needs to be purely out of necessity for the pianist to be able to physically play the work.

There are some common patterns that transcribers resort to for various musical textures. For instance, it is extremely common for 2 or more instrumental sections to play tremolos or straight 16ths. Perhaps they are playing at an interval with relation to each other or even doubling at the octave.

For a pianist to play rapidly repeating notes takes *an entire
hand*, and that's only for repetition on a single key and takes a very specialized technique requiring 2-4 fingers alternating on the key rapidly. To play a chord with the same rapidity is near-impossible, or, at the very least, considered highly un-pianistic. Transcribers will often transform these textures into tremolos, where the hand "rotates" back and forth between the two notes. This is technically information loss, but the texture is preserved, and so it is considered a good practice.

Finally, I am not an expert transcriber. My training is in performance, not composition - and knowing your way around a piano is only one part of the equation in creating a good reduction. Having outside input from trained composers is what the project will need eventually.
